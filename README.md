# Emerging-Technologies-Tensorflow
This repository contains the solutions to the fourth problem sheet on TensorFlow given as part of my fourth year emerging technologies module in college. These problems use the famous iris data set. This data set was downloaded from a [previous problem sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KeithWilliamsGMIT/Emerging-Technologies-Jupyter/master/data/iris.csv). All solutions are contained in a single Jupyter notebook file. Note that the solutions to these problems were written in Python 3.5.

## Getting Started
To start the jupyter notebook first clone the repository and then use the jupyter notebook command as follows.

```
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/KeithWilliamsGMIT/Emerging-Technologies-Tensorflow.git

# Navigate to the root of the repo
cd Emerging-Technologies-Tensorflow

# Start the notebook
jupyter notebook
```

The notebook file is called `tensorflow.ipynb`.

## Problems to solve

### 1. Use Tensorflow to create model
Use Tensorflow to create a model to predict the species of Iris from a flowerâ€™s sepal width, sepal length, petal width, and petal length.

### 2. Split the data into training and testing
Split the data set into a training set and a testing set. You should investigate the best way to do this, and list any online references used in your notebook. If you wish to, you can write some code to randomly separate the data on the fly.

### 3. Train the model
Use the testing set to train your model.

### 4. Test the model
Use the testing set to test your model, clearly calculating and displaying the error rate.
